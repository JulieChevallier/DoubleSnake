# DoubleSnake

DoubleSnake is a two-player game developed in C++ using the SDL2 library. The objective of the game is for each player to control their snake and eliminate the other player's snake by making it collide with their own body.

This project was developed by [Quentin MÃ©lotte](https://github.com/Nayggets) and myself as a `personal project` for fun.

## How to play

* Player 1 : Use the arrow keys to control your snake's movement.
* Player 2 : Use ZQSD to control your snake's movement.
* Your snake's body will grow as it eats the food that appears randomly on the screen.
* The snakes move continuously in the direction that the player specifies.
* The game ends when one of the snakes crashes into into the other snake's body.
* The player whose snake survives wins the game.
